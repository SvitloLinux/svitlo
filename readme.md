## For whom this distribution is planned

 üî∏ Educational institutions (schools, universities) - as an OS with an open license and a set of accompanying software
 
 üî∏ State services - taking into account completely open software, a high level of safety and security (it is planned to obtain the relevant certificates and licenses), as well as support for full logging of actions performed by the user

 üî∏ To sellers of computers and laptops - as an OS for pre-sale installation. (Ease of installation, a set of tools for demonstrating the characteristics of the processor and video card)

 üî∏ Individuals who like convenience, simplicity and reliability with full protection and security



## Philosophy


The light of GNU/Linux is designed to be: simple, clear, logical, understandable, open and secure


* Simple and clear interface
* Obvious and useful software
* Security and full encryption of stored data, a unique installation key is generated during installation
* Prohibition of information tracking and transmission of any analytics, whether browser or any installed software



The goal is to have a system that the user can use immediately after installation, and with a powerful yet simple package manager/management system to customize the software for their needs.
